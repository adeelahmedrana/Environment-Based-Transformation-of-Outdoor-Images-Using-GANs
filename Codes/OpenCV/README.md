## Code Description

This directory contains various Python scripts that are used throughout the project for different image processing tasks and model operations. The file names are self-explanatory, reflecting the specific function each script performs. Below is a brief overview:

- **concat.py**: Script for concatenating images.
- **crop.py**: Used to crop images to a desired size.
- **Image 2 Gray and Guassian.py**: Converts images to grayscale and applies Gaussian blur.
- **Image Gausian Blur.py**: Applies a Gaussian blur to images.
- **jpgmachine.py**: Handles JPEG image processing tasks.
- **OpenCV.py**: Contains functions related to OpenCV operations.
- **OpenCVManipulations.py**: A collection of image manipulation functions using OpenCV.
- **pix2pix_model.py**: Implements the Pix2Pix model architecture and training routines.
- **rename.py**: Script for renaming image files.
- **resize.py**: Resizes images to a specified dimension.
- **same_format.py**: Ensures all images are in the same format.
- **select_images.py**: Selects images from directories based on criteria.
- **seperate images.py**: Separates images into different categories or folders.
- **sewar.py**: Contains functions for image quality assessment.

These scripts are integral to the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation processes within this project.
